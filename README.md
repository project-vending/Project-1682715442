#  Real-time Data Visualization Tool using Streamlit and KinesisOne of the interesting projects that can be done using Streamlit and Kinesis is to build a real-time data visualization tool. The tool can be designed to capture streaming data from AWS Kinesis, process and analyze it, and present the results in a visually informative way using Streamlit. This project can be useful for monitoring various types of data streams such as financial transactions, social media trends, stock prices, and more.
